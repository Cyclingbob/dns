# dns
A dns server panel thingy i took the name from cpanel... its not cpanel... lmao

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/wiresboy-exe/dns`

Open the ports 80, 2090, 2052

`npm i` to install stuff

On port 2090 you can setup your admin username and password (top form) and create user accounts (bottom form) you can also view logs (scroll to the bottom)
Default login Name: `Admin`, Pass: `Admin`

On port 2052 you have user accounts, logs and domains

On port 80 thats where the porxy is... its quite simple
